# Draft Paper Outline — Hyperpersonalization via NLP on Amazon Reviews

## 1. Introduction
- Motivation: Word‑level signals power 1:1 marketing.
- Contributions: compare interpretable baseline vs Transformer on Amazon reviews; demonstrate clustering for micro‑segments.

## 2. Related Work
- Sentiment analysis in marketing.
- Customer segmentation with text.
- Contextual models for intent detection.

## 3. Methods
- Datasets: Amazon Polarity; labeling approach for personas.
- Models: TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression; DistilBERT fine‑tuning.
- Clustering: K‑Means over TF‑IDF, PCA for visualization.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Macro‑F1, Confusion Matrix.

## 4. Experiments
- Splits, training details, hyper‑parameters.
- Baseline vs Transformer results.
- Cluster interpretability (top terms per cluster).

## 5. Discussion
- Trade‑offs: interpretability vs performance.
- Practical personalization playbooks from language clusters.

## 6. Limitations & Ethics
- Weak labeling bias; data representativeness; privacy.

## 7. Conclusion & Future Work
- Deployable path for hyperpersonalized marketing.
- Next steps: BERTopic; multimodal features (images/price).
